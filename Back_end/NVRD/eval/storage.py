#         def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
#             try:
#                 this = MyModelName.objects.get(id=self.id)

#                     this.MyImageFieldName.delete()
#             except: pass
#             super(MyModelName, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
#         """
#         # If the filename already exists, remove it as if it was a true file system
#         if self.exists(name):
#             os.remove(os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR+'/eval/student_images', name))
